    <h1> I Taught Myself To Live Simply </h1>
    <p> I taught myself to live simply and wisely, <br>
to look at the sky and pray to God,<br>
and to wander long before evening<br>
to tire my superfluous worries.<br>
When the burdocks rustle in the ravine<br>
and the yellow-red rowanberry cluster droops<br>
I compose happy verses<br>
about life's decay, decay and beauty.<br>
I come back. The fluffy cat<br>
licks my palm, purrs so sweetly<br>
and the fire flares bright<br>
on the saw-mill turret by the lake.<br>
Only the cry of a stork landing on the roof
occasionally breaks the silence.<br>
If you knock on my door<br>
I may not even hear. </p>
